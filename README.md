# Abstract
The abstract provides a concise overview of an electric bottle with built-in cooling and heating functionalities.
This innovative device aims to revolutionize the way beverages are stored and maintained at desired temperatures.
By integrating both cooling and heating capabilities within a portable bottle, users can enjoy their preferred drinks at
their preferred temperature, whether hot or cold.The electric bottle employs advanced thermoelectric technology to 
achieve efficient cooling and heating.The cooling functionality utilizes the Peltier effect, allowing the bottle to lower
the temperature of beverages inside by transferring heat from the liquid to the external environment.Similarly, the
heating functionality employs the same technology in reverse, effectively raising the temperature of the contents. To 
provide user-friendly control, the electric bottle is equipped with an intuitive interface that allows for easy
temperature adjustment. Users can set their desired temperature using the integrated control panel or a companion
smartphone application. The bottle is equipped with sensors that monitor and maintain the desired temperature,
ensuring optimal enjoyment of the beverage for an extended period.

# Introduction
In a world where convenience and customization are valued, the demand for innovative solutions to everyday
problems continues to grow. One such area that has captured significant attention is the maintenance of desired
beverage temperatures while on the go. Traditional thermoses and insulated bottles have long been relied upon, but 
their limitations in maintaining both hot and cold temperatures have left room for improvement. To address this
need, the concept of an electric bottle with built-in coolers and heaters has emerged, offering a groundbreaking
solution to the age-old problem of beverage temperature control. The electric bottle represents a fusion of advanced
technology and practical design, revolutionizing the way beverages are stored and enjoyed. By integrating cooling
and heating capabilities into a portable and user-friendly container, individuals now have the power to customize
their drinking experience wherever they may be. With the application of thermoelectric technology, the electric bottle
provides efficient cooling and heating functionalities. This technology leverages the Peltier effect, enabling the
transfer of heat between the beverage inside the bottle and the external environment. By utilizing this principle, the
electric bottle can rapidly cool down a drink to an icy refreshment or elevate it to a steaming hot beverage, all while
preserving the desired temperature for extended periods.
